      <p>
        The lightest of all pastas. A significant portion of its sauce is...
        water. Yes, you read that right, water from the cooking pasta plays a
        crucial role here, and although there's also cream and butter, it only
        strengthens our belief that it will be truly divine. Most importantly,
        the main star is lemon (used from every possible angle), which
        transforms the pasta into something truly extraordinary. But, you have
        to try it for yourselves.

      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>1 lemon</li>
        <li>200 g pasta (preferably spaghetti or tagliatelle)</li>
        <li>½ cup (120 ml) heavy cream (30% fat)</li>
        <li>3 full tablespoons cold butter</li>
        <li>⅓ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>freshly ground pepper, salt</li>
      </ul>

    <div class="procedure">
      <h3>What to do</h3>
      <p>
        Use a vegetable peeler or a knife to remove a 5 cm strip of lemon zest.
        Finely chop it into thin strips. Grate the remaining lemon zest using a
        fine grater, measure out half of it, and save the rest for other
        culinary purposes. Squeeze 1 tablespoon of lemon juice and set it aside.
        In a medium saucepan, pour the heavy cream and add the lemon zest. Bring
        it to a boil. Reduce the heat to low and, while continuously stirring
        with a whisk, add the cold butter one tablespoon at a time. Make sure
        each piece is melted before adding the next. Meanwhile, cook the pasta
        al dente (1 minute less than the time indicated on the package, as it
        will continue cooking in the sauce). Measure out 1 cup of the pasta
        cooking water and add ⅓ cup of it to the creamy butter sauce along with
        the pasta. The sauce may seem too liquid and resemble soup, but it will
        thicken significantly. Increase the heat to medium and add the grated
        Parmesan cheese, one tablespoon at a time, while stirring frequently.
        Season with salt, pepper, and 1 tablespoon of lemon juice. If needed,
        thin out the sauce with more of the pasta cooking water. Transfer the
        pasta to serving bowls, sprinkle with the previously chopped lemon zest,
        and add an extra amount of freshly ground pepper.
