      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
        Risotto Alla Milanese is a special dish from Italian cuisine that
        originates from Milan. It is a delicate and creamy risotto that gets its
        characteristic golden color from saffron. Preparing Risotto Alla
        Milanese requires patience and precision. The rice is sautéed in butter
        or olive oil with finely chopped onions, and then gradually simmered
        with broth until it becomes tender and creamy. Additionally, white dry
        wine and Parmesan cheese are added to the risotto, giving it a rich
        flavor. Risotto Alla Milanese is a perfect accompaniment to various meat
        dishes or can be enjoyed on its own with grated Parmesan cheese and
        fresh parsley. This exceptional risotto delights not only with its taste
        but also with its beautiful appearance, making it a true delight for the
        palate.

      <h3>What to do</h3>
      <p>
        Bring water to a boil with 1 teaspoon of salt. Reduce the heat to low.
        Heat olive oil in a large skillet or oven-proof pot over medium heat.
        Sauté the onion with a pinch of salt for 4-5 minutes until golden brown.
        Add the rice and stir well to coat it with the oil. Sauté, stirring
        frequently, for 3-4 minutes until the rice becomes translucent. Increase
        the heat, pour in the wine, and let it evaporate. Pour in the first
        ladle of prepared water, about 1/3 cup. Stir and cook for 2-3 minutes
        until the rice absorbs almost all of the water. Stir, add the next
        portion of water. Repeat the process until the rice becomes plump,
        cooked, but still al dente. You may not need to use all the water, but
        the mixture should be liquid (more than your intuition suggests). This
        will take around 20-25 minutes. Remove from heat. Stir in the Parmesan
        cheese, then add the mascarpone and lemon zest. The risotto should be
        very creamy and liquid - it should spread on the plate. Add more water
        if needed. Season with freshly ground pepper. Serve it as is, with just
        a sprinkle of Parmesan cheese and lemon zest. Or with your favorite
        additions. Anchovies, sautéed zucchini slices, and a pinch of cumin work
        great. It's umami, light, and slightly exotic.
